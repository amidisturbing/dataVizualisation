In this excersise we examine animal bites registered in the U.S from

### The columns

*head_sent_date* has the most missing values since not every head of the animal which was registered is cut off and send to the department of health care.# Introduction

In this exercise, we examine animal bites registered in the U.S from

The repository can be found on [Github](https://github.com/amidisturbing/datavis2018).

## The data

**Data source: https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/animal-bites (June 2018)**

The original data source contains 19826 rows and 18 columns.

The columns names are "ID", "bite_date", "SpeciesIDDesc", "BreedIDDesc", "GenderIDDesc", "color", "vaccination_yrs", "vaccination_date", "victim_zip", "AdvIssuedYNDesc", "WhereBittenIDDesc", "quarantine_date", "DispositionIDDesc", "head_sent_date", "release_date", "ResultsIDDesc", "FollowupYNDesc", "ResolveCompYesNo".

The column "FollowupYNDesc" was added by mistake, according to the current Data Manager and Performance Partner of the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, Gerald (Jerry) Kaforski.

The column "head_sent_date" has the most missing values since not every head of the animal which was registered is cut off and send to the department of health care.

Taking a closer look at the column "bite_date", we find some the year1952 until the year 5013.

## Preparation

The missing values of the dataset were converted to **NA**. 

The values in "bite_date" were limited to the period between the 5th of May 1985 and the 21st of June 2018.
# Analysis

At first we want to visualize the first five Species which are involved in Animal Bites in the given timeperiod.
